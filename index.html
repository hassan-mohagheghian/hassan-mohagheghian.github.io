<h1> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<p>
  I'm a software developer with seven years experience, previous full stack and currently back-end developer. 
  I went step by step and took good steps in both programming and product development. In programming, I have gone from a simple function to design and architecture patterns, and in product development, I have collaborated in the development of products in various fields, from the field of IT to the business of selling store products.
  I have been working with Python and Javascript and collaborated on multiple project from tiny to big scales.
  Currently I'm continuing to my journey in software development with Django and FasAPI in Web layer and learning more about data layer. Also, Rust is popular.
